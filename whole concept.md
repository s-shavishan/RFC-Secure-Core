# ✅ Step-by-Step Flow for RFC-Secure-Core™ Execution

---

🔸 1. 🔁 User runs script → generates fingerprint
```js
const fingerprint = generateFingerprint(); // 🔐 includes os + cwd + boot_id + secret (you have to think a better way)
console.log('Your fingerprint:', fingerprint);
```
---

You ask them to:

📸 Send screenshot or copy it

📥 You manually add it to your fingerprints.txt or DB

---

🔸 2. 🔐 You approve it
You take their fingerprint and:

Add to backend DB or .txt

Now only this fingerprint will be allowed to download + decrypt ultra-lock

```txt
# valid-fingerprints.txt
c1184562deba... (user A)
47be39ad19d0... (user B)
```

---

🔸 3. 📦 When bot starts, it re-generates the fingerprint
```js
const fingerprint = generateFingerprint();
```
Then it sends:

```js
POST /get-ultra-key
{
  authKey: "SpartanMD",
  fingerprint: "c1184562deba...",
  token: sha256(fingerprint)
}
```

---

🔸 4. 🔐 Server verifies:
Is this fingerprint approved?

Has this token already been used?

✅ If yes → return key + IV

❌ Else → reject

🧠 Why it works
This method is super secure because:

🔁 Fingerprint always regenerates same value on same panel instance

🧬 You are the only one who can approve

🔐 Key is never shared without verification

🔒 Your lock code never lives on disk

👨‍⚖️ Even if they rerun script, fingerprint must match DB

⚠️ Security Reminder
You must use:

cwd ✅ (changes per panel/container)

boot_id ✅ (changes per system boot)

Optional .env token ✅

Otherwise, if you only use os.hostname() or cpu, it can be cloned!

## Bonus - Tip

use url genarate back end (one time access urls)
so each link can be used one time
