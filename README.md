## 🚀 What is RFC-Secure-Core?

RFC-Secure-Core is a next-gen startup + protection layer designed to deliver encrypted code securely and execute it directly in memory.
This Project is On Development and will releasing soon stay tuned. 

Follow the ©The RedFox-Coders™ channel on WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb2tpBZ4tRrkXZ2fIV0a

Ideal for:
- Bots
- Proprietary logic
- API clients
- Private scripts that must NOT leak

# 🚀 Why RFC-Secure-Core™?

Wanna drop your bot on GitHub without exposing the real source code?
Then, RFC-Secure-Core™ is exactly what you need. 💣

Hide your logic. Confuse the leakers. Stay in control. ✅

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ AES-256 encrypted delivery  
✅ No code written to disk  
✅ Fingerprint-based download auth  
✅ Runtime-only decryption  
✅ One-time key delivery  
✅ Easy to integrate into existing Node.js apps

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. `start.js` fingerprints the machine  
2. Contact your secure API to fetch the key & IV  
3. Downloads encrypted core (`ultra-lock.encrypted.js`)  
4. Decrypts & runs **entirely in RAM**  
5. Core self-protects using runtime traps

---

## 🛡️ Real-World Use Cases

- WhatsApp bots (NOIEYS-X)
- Panel-deployed scripts
- Cloud-hosted custom runtimes
- Docker container guards

---

## 📦 Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedFox-Coders/RFC-Secure-Core
cd RFC-Secure-Core
npm install
```
## 🧪 Testing It
```bash

- You need a server for this project hosted on the network
-Join our channel to learn more
******

# 1. Write your real logic in ultra-lock.example.js
# 2. Run encryption
node encrypt-lock.js

# 3. Launch secure loader
node start.js
```

⚠️ WARNING
🚫 Never publish ultra-lock.encrypted.js with real keys in public repos - Make Your server
✅ Whitelist verified fingerprints in server/config.js
🧠 This is only the loader — the secure backend is your responsibility. [Want to help? Join our channel and community.]
